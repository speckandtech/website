## About the company

At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers.
A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and
efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to
high ethical standards.<br/>

To achieve this mission, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it
as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and
company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus,
our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.<br/>

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact,
and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.<br/>

We're seeking exceptional engineers interested in working in backend, data, infrastructure, mobile, or security & privacy.
Don’t worry if you are not sure about what area would suit you best: We’ll have time to determine what’s likely to be the
ideal fit for you.<br/>

No matter your seniority, you will work on production code, directly improving our products or adding new exceptional
features. At the moment, most teams use Python, Typescript, or Java for the backend, and Kotlin and Swift for mobile. Our
approach to software development is highly flexible, and we adapt our tech stack to the needs of the different products.<br/>

<br/>

## A few examples of your responsibilities

* Work closely with other software engineers to expand our set of libraries and make our processes ever-more efficient.
* Learn about the latest and greatest technologies, testing the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on
game-changing opportunities to boost our productivity and the enjoyment of our work.
* Constantly improve the quality of our products, tools, or infrastructures by fixing bugs and refactoring the code
base where necessary.

<br/>

## What we look for

* **Reasoning ability.** Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles,
and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
* **Drive.** You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity
of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
* **Team spirit.** You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not
your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
* **Proficiency in English.** You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.
* **You can work at least 25 hours per week.** A full-time commitment is preferred, but we’ll consider applicants who can
commit to around 25 hours per week.

<br/>

## What we offer

* **Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.** You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some
of the brightest people in your field.
* **An exceptional opportunity for growth.** We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then,
our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of
millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
* **Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.** Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career
a salary of €63,965. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between
€105,737 and €143,330. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also
receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve
together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
* **All. These. Benefits.** Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training,
top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a
stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.
