## Powering the autonomous drone revolution.

Skycharge builds the charging backbone for autonomous drone operations.
From ports to industrial sites defense and public safety missions, our systems enable 24/7 automatic and autonomous UAVs by combining fully automatic drone docking, charging, remote drone storage and servicing.
Founded in Berlin, we’re now expanding production and R&D to Trento, Italy. This is a key step in scaling up our European manufacturing and technology development base.
We’re a fast-moving, engineering-driven team focused on building real systems that make autonomy practical, safe, and scalable.

## About the Role

We’re looking for a hands-on **Embedded Software Engineer** to help design and scale Skycharge’s autonomous charging and hangar systems for drones.
You’ll work at the intersection of hardware, firmware, power and remote device control, building the code that keeps our drone infrastructure operational, supporting the most diverse UAV applications.
This is a core technical position in a small, high-performance team where precision, ownership, and real-world results matter more than titles.

## What You’ll Do

* Design and develop embedded software for Skycharge’s next-generation of drone and robot charging systems
* Implement firmware for power management, communication and system control
* Collaborate with electronics and mechanical engineers to ensure seamless integration
* Optimize system performance, reliability and safety across diverse environments
* Support testing, validation and field deployments of new firmware versions
* Maintain high-quality technical documentation and version control
* Contribute to the architecture and roadmap of next-generation charging platforms

## What You Bring

* Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering or Embedded Software Engineering
* Minimum 2–5+ years of experience in embedded software development
* Proficiency in C/C++ for microcontrollers (e.g. STM32, ESP32, NXP, or similar)
* Experience with communication protocols (CAN, UART, RS485, Modbus, Ethernet, etc.)
* Solid understanding of embedded systems debugging and testing tools in Linux-based development environments.
* Ability to work independently and take end-to-end ownership of your modules.
* Experience with GIT code versioning.

## Nice to Have

* Background in power electronics, robotics or drone systems
* Experience with RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr, or similar)
* Experience with DroneCAN communication protocols
* Familiarity with CE certification and EMC compliance processes
* Experience with backend integration for IoT systems, ideally using AWS IoT Core and related cloud services.
* A passion for outdoor and/or a sport where you like to improve

## Why Join Us

* ✅  Build systems used by real drone fleets across Europe
* ⚙️  Build cutting-edge embedded systems that power real-world drone and robot fleets 
* 🏗️ Enjoy ownership and autonomy to make an immediate impact
* 🌍 Work in the heart of the Dolomites, surrounded by engineering talent and nature
* 🚀 We are visionary first movers and pioneers in our field: first to design and market a drone charging station in 2015 with patents granted in US, EU, JP.
