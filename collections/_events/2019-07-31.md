      HERE Technologies, already a world leader in digital mapping, is today one of the main
      global players in Location Services. After a brief company overview we will introduce
      the HERE Developer Portal (developer.here.com), the online portal that allows developers
      to access the HERE Location Services and create innovative solutions in various sectors â€”
      Autonomous Drive, IoT, Mobility on Demand, Transport & Logistics. We will then delve
      into a few scenarios where our APIs are used to embed #maps (static, dynamic or interactive)
      or to include venue maps, or weather forecast. Weâ€™ll have a look at our Search and Geocoding
      capabilities to find places and addresses, at our Routing and Navigation APIs including
      Traffic and Intermodal routing (car, pedestrian, bike, transit) and at some advanced ones,
      like the captivating Geofencing (receiving feedback when something gets in/out a chosen area).

  - title: "Building Smart Green Mobility in South Tyrol through an Open Data Hub"
    speakers:
      - name: Roberto Cavaliere
        role: ITS Project Manager
        org: IDM Suedtirol

      For decades the traditional approach for solving mobility and transportation challenges
      has been based on the idea of creating new road or rail infrastructures. Thanks to the
      impressive enhancement of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies, in the
      last years this approach is going into the direction of rather improving the efficiency
      of how available transportation infrastructure is used ðŸšŒ New digital infrastructures
      allow all mobility actors (vehicles, pedestrians, sensors, traffic management centers)
      to cooperate together to achieve the ambitious goal of improving mobility, enhancing
      safety, reducing congestion and environmental impacts. But how can we achieve this and
      ensure that public and private actors efficiently work together? In South Tyrol we have
      tried to give an answer to these challenges through the implementation of an open data
      hub, which enables the real-time data / information exchange among all interested parties
      and fosters the multiplication of development of research & innovation projects between
      local companies, research centers and public organizations. After years of implementation,
      the Open Data Hub South Tyrol is now creating the premises for a new historical phase for
      mobility in the region, with concepts like Mobility-as-a-Service or environmental traffic
      management that are finally moving from research to deployment.
