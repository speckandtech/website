      The majority of experts agree that 2016 US elections were targeted by IRA (Internet
      Research Agency), a Russian pro-government company that used the social networks to
      interfere with the elections. Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube have become useful tools
      for Russian propaganda to sway the voters. In October 2018, Twitter released a big
      dataset containing all the tweets - over 9 million - shared by the Russian trolls.
      The analysed data show how Internet Research Agency has carefully developed its propaganda.
      This talk wants to illustrate how Russian propaganda on Twitter has worked.

      Studying and breaking secure hardware is not something that only state-sponsored attackers
      or highly-funded research groups can perform. Tools are becoming more accessible and you can
      start learning hardware security at home üè† Hardware hacking is perceived as black magic or
      something not important: let's change this misconception, learn about new classes of attacks
      and how to design secure hardware.
