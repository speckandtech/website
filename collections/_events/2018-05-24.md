      According to one of the reference courses on the topic, Process Mining is Data Science
      in Action: the "missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented
      analysis techniques". Indeed it consists of a series of techniques that enable the (i)
      discovery, (ii) monitoring, and (iii) improvement of real processes (i.e., not assumed
      processes) leveraging the knowledge contained in today's (information) systems and
      represented in the format of so-called event logs.<br />
      In this presentation I will provide an overview of the main components of process
      mining, namely: the automated process discovery from event logs, the checking of
      conformance (or deviations) of the process model and the event log, and the improvement
      of models based on the actual process executions contained in the event log. I will
      also illustrate in detail some of the work we carry out on predictive process monitoring,
      that is, the ability of foreseen the future unfolding of current process executions.

  - title: "Taking Process Mining from a technical software solution to a full enterprise ready platform"

      Serving the largest companies in the world with a state of the art software is a
      challenge: it’s not just the solution of a calculation problem or the invention of a new
      algorithm but generating value on the customers data. Manuel Haug shares various
      experiences in facing this challenge. These include shifting minds and making people
      realize that enterprise software can be modern, easy to use and user centric, but also
      security and data regulations and necessary steps to develop a customer-specific value
      proposition.
