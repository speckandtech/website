      Large Language Models (LLMs) have proved extraordinary capabilities in language
      understanding and generation, but their most promising feature is probably their
      reasoning capability. The fact that LLMs can understand complex problems, plan
      step-by-step solutions, and even work by intuition, make them powerful reasoning
      engine to be placed at the core of AI-powered application. In this session,
      we are going to explore how LLMs are revolutionizing the world of software
      development and paving the way for a new landscape for LLM-powered applications.

  - title: Why LLMs Should Be Handled With Care

      Ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT, LLMs have been applied to the most diverse
      domains, from education to medicine. However, what they basically do is to look
      for patterns in huge amounts of text and use those patterns to guess what the
      next word in a string is. Having no access to the real world, LLMs are therefore
      great at mimicry but show important limitations when employed for critical tasks,
      which may affect human well-being, social justice, and access to digital services.
      This talk will discuss all the above issues, highlighting the risks but also the
      huge potential of LLMs.
