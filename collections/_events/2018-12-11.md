    description: >
      Indoor location information will soon be a commodity, available everywhere/anywhere.
      Similarly to how GPS changed our way of experiencing the outdoor, indoor localisation
      will have an impact on how we will shop, visit a hospital or run a manufacturing plant.
      Location intelligence is about connecting the dots on the map to provide value-added
      services for end users. In this talk we will have a short journey on how location
      intelligence will affect our way of experiencing physical spaces, and on the
      enabling technologies.
