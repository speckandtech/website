      Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are two of the most chatted technologies currently, but also for
      programmers these are fields still unexplored. VR and AR carry uncommon issues indeed, especially when the
      involvement of the user, and his immersion in the new environment, must be considered as one of the main goals
      the application has to achieve. After a brief analysis of these problems, and how to solve them in theoretical
      ways, focus will be moved on a practical case, discussing about how a VR experience can be built up using a
      modern game engine and the solutions it provides to solve the computational and cyber sickness issues.
