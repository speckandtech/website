      Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are an emerging, highly flexible and Web-friendly technology
      for integrating, representing, and querying semi-structured data in a semantically
      rich model formalized by an Ontology. KGs may be built using specialized data
      management software (e.g., triplestores) or, by leveraging suitable mappings
      and query rewriting techniques, as "Virtual Knowledge Graph" (VKG) views over
      some legacy data source, such as a relational database. In this talk, we provide
      background information on VKGs and their underlying technologies, with particular
      emphasis on the open-source Ontop VKG engine, and we discuss ongoing research
      and development efforts towards their extension to Web APIs as a non-relational
      data source of practical relevance. This extension, supported by the HIVE and
      OntoCRM projects, would also enable transparent access to both static relational
      data and dynamically-computed Web API data as part of a regular VKG query.

  - title: Why You Should Get A Worse Computer

      We're used to thinking of technology as always progressing, and in terms of hardware
      that's definitely true: CPUs are getting more powerful, memory cheaper, networks
      faster, and so on, forever. But why does it feel like actually using computers is
      getting slower and shittier? Abundant computing resources and a culture of optimizing
      for developer productivity above all else have led to a situation where most hardware
      improvements are instantly negated by software inefficiency. This is a problem known
      from other domains (such as traffic flow), where increasing capacity is paradoxically
      not reducing but rather increasing the load on the system, resulting in a worse overall
      outcome. This talk discusses how we could approach this problem as a field, and makes
      some provocative recommendations â€” such as getting a worse computer.
