  - title: "Climate Change and Water resources in the Alps. Which future is waiting for us?"
    speakers:
      - name: Giacomo Bertoldi
        role: Senior Researcher
        org: EURAC
        org_link: https://www.eurac.edu/en/institutes-centers/institute-for-alpine-environment
    slides: http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/BOqhxGvbNR9OuZ
    description: >
      Current climate change is already affecting water resource availability in the Alps.
      In this talk, we will give an overview of the current and future impacts of climate
      change in our region on water and related sectors, and show how data and computational
      models could help quantify water resources and better plan adaptation strategies.

  - title: "The new technological frontier in Water Resources Management: the Digital Twin of the catchment area"
    speakers:

    description: >
      How much water is there and when will it become available? These are the questions
      most water managers, like hydropower operators or water utilities, are asking to
      comply with water supply. The water discharge in a river is the result of a complex
      hydrological balance that starts in the upper part of the catchment and continues
      downstream: precipitation, snow melting, evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff
      are all processes that contribute to water availability. With climate change, current
      prediction procedures, often based purely on historical data, are incapable of following
      the new climatic trend. A new approach based on satellite imageries, physical models
      and machine learning is getting the edge in the market, with higher accuracy and a
      global reach: the Digital Twin aims to digitize processes in order to be replicated
      in a virtual concept, to better monitor water availability and forecast its evolution.
