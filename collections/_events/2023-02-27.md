talks:

  - title: "Building Large Science Space Projects"
    speakers:
      - name: Carlo Zanoni
        role: Mechanical Engineer
        org: National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN)
        org_link: https://home.infn.it/it
    slides: http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/r1X5i6h9Ksgiqx

      Publicly funded space missions are a means for states to advance technological
      development and acquire or maintain strategic knowledge while providing
      telecommunications services, earth observation, exploration, and investigation
      of the fundamental laws of the universe. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
      (LISA) is the European Space Agencyâ€™s large-class science mission of the next
      decade and sees a substantial contribution from the Italian Space Agency.
      This talk will introduce the key aspects of LISA and use it as an example to
      explain the organization and development process of these complex
      international projects (including why they take so long).

  - title: "Space is Open for Business"
    speakers:
      - name: Linda Mazzotti
        role: Associate
        org: Primo Space
        org_link: https://www.primo.vc/primospace

    description: >
      The falling cost of building and launching rockets, the miniaturisation
      of technologies, and the ambition of entrepreneurs and innovators have led
      to a new era for space. Otherwise known as 'new space', it has relevance
      to everyone and is increasingly backed by private finance. This is precisely
      when venture capital came into play.

  - title: "AI and Space: Finally, No More Arguing with the GPS"
    speakers:
      - name: Mattia Varile
        role: CIO
        org: AIKO Space
        org_link: http://aikospace.com
    slides: http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/t37dhn6SsFIGWM
    description: >
      This talk will be about how AIKO is revolutionizing how space missions
      are operated, thanks to the use of Artificial Intelligence both on-board
      the spacecraft and on-ground, in the mission control centers. AI is posed
      to be one of the game-changers of the space industry, helping to achieve
      more scalable, profitable missions that deliver more relevant and
      usable data. AIKO is leading this.
