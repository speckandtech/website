      Virtually every company today uses firewalls to enforce perimeter security. However, this security model is
      problematic because, when that perimeter is breached, an attacker has relatively easy access to a companyâ€™s
      privileged intranet. As companies adopt mobile and cloud technologies, the perimeter is becoming
      increasingly difficult to enforce. Google is taking a different approach to network security. We are
      removing the requirement for a privileged intranet and moving our corporate applications to the Internet.

    description: >
      Bitcoin and blockchain technology are probably the most noteworthy application of modern cryptography.
      Whereas Internet has mainly changed how we share and publish content, distribute ledgers will bring a
      structural revolution in every field where data storage and transmission are involved, starting from the
      concept of money and finance. After a meticulous technical analysis of how Bitcoin and blockchain
      technology actually work, light will be shed on how and under which circumstances this revolution
      will take place.
