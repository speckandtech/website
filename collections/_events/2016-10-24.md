      Virtually every company today uses firewalls to enforce perimeter security. However, this security model is
      problematic because, when that perimeter is breached, an attacker has relatively easy access to a companyâ€™s
      privileged intranet. As companies adopt mobile and cloud technologies, the perimeter is becoming
      increasingly difficult to enforce. Google is taking a different approach to network security. We are
      removing the requirement for a privileged intranet and moving our corporate applications to the Internet.

      Bitcoin and blockchain technology are probably the most noteworthy application of modern cryptography.
      Whereas Internet has mainly changed how we share and publish content, distribute ledgers will bring a
      structural revolution in every field where data storage and transmission are involved, starting from the
      concept of money and finance. After a meticulous technical analysis of how Bitcoin and blockchain
      technology actually work, light will be shed on how and under which circumstances this revolution
      will take place.
