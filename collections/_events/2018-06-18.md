      Oval Money was conceived from the union of heart, mind and skills of 4 entrepreneurs
      diverse in culture and experience ðŸ¤Ÿ To Oval I brought design and the desire to innovate
      linked to it. I have always believed in solving problems through design and am firmly
      convinced it must be the driver and the foundation of each product, combined with a
      team motivated to grow with the challenges that doing business puts you in front of
      every day.

      With fintech companies growing everywhere around the world, traditional banks need to
      choose where to stand. In a journey through PSD2, APIs and service integration weâ€™ll see
      what possibilities lie ahead when banks stop behaving like banks. P.S. weâ€™ll have a few
      tech demos too!
