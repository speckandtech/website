      A liquid biopsy is a test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer cells or for
      pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are circulating in the blood. In this talk I
      will introduce the notion of liquid biopsy and report how a minimally invasive blood
      test can be developed using next-generation sequencing technology on circulating
      tumor DNA obtained from plasma. I will also show the capacity of this test to
      interrogate for disease evolution and identify genomic aberrations that emerge
      with drug resistance.

  - title: "Reinventing physical therapy and rehabilitation"
    speakers:

      This talk will present the adventure of building a medical device that wants to
      revolutionize the way physical therapy is performed around the world, by using
      wearable sensors and innovative software that meet the requirements of patients
      and healthcare professionals around the world.
