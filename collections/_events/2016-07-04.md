      As mobile devices have become ubiquitous in our everyday life, information security is now a fundamental
      topic for every technology professional. Moreover, many events in the last few years have changed how the
      average user thinks about security of the devices they’re using.<br />
      In this talk, we will walk through the defence in depth approach adopted by Apple’s iOS, one of the most
      secure platforms of the world. In particular, he will offer an overview of the iOS security model by
      explaining all the security measures put in place by Apple and by going over all the steps required to
      compromise an iOS device, from the point of view of an hypothetical attacker.

  - title: "The Right to be Forgotten"

      Have you ever heard about the "Right to be forgotten"? This has been one of the most controversial topics
      in the past few years. Indeed, while on the one hand this was defined as "the right to silence past events
      in life that are no longer occurring", on the other it was termed as "the biggest threat to free speech
      on the Internet in the coming decade".<br />
      At first, this talk is going to introduce what the "Right to be forgotten" is, by focusing especially on
      how this concept was born and how companies like Google or Facebook treat our privacy. We will then boost
      the discussion with a few examples, which are particularly relevant to the subject, and allowed this topic
      to become popular and highly debated.
