  - title: "Edge AI: Bringing Intelligence to Embedded Devices"
    speakers:
      - name: Leonardo Cavagnis
        role: Firmware Engineer
        org: Arduino
        org_link: https://www.arduino.cc
    slides: https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/uaTI7LTLevhYNj

      Artificial intelligence is no longer confined to the cloud. Thanks to Edge AI, we can now run AI models directly on embedded devices with limited power and resources. This session will explore the full pipeline of developing a Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) model, from data collection to deployment, addressing key challenges such as dataset preparation, model training, quantization, and optimization for embedded systems. We’ll explore real-world use cases where AI-powered embedded systems enable smart decision-making in applications like predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and voice recognition. The talk will include a live hands-on demonstration on how to train and deploy a model using popular tools like Google Colab and TensorFlow, and then run real-time inference on an Arduino board.

  - title: "Cognitive Robotics: from Babies to Robots and AI"
    speakers:
      - name: Angelo Cangelosi
        role: Professor of Machine Learning and Robotics
        org: University of Manchester
        org_link: https://www.manchester.ac.uk

      Can robots learn languages like humans do? This talk dives into Cognitive Robotics, where AI, Psychology, and Neuroscience join forces to teach robots how we think, learn, and communicate. Researchers use iCub and Pepper robots to explore how babies acquire words, gestures, and even abstract concepts like numbers. But it’s not just about words: robots also develop a Theory of Mind, learning to interpret human intentions and build trust. The discussion goes beyond tech, tackling ethics, AI’s limits, and the future of human-robot collaboration. Can machines truly understand us? Let’s find it out!
