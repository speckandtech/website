      <i>I’ve worked at Cloudflare for more than seven years. Cloudflare itself is more than
      eight years old. So, I’ve been there since it was a very small company. About twenty
      people in fact. All of those people (except one, me) worked from an office in San Francisco.
      I was the lone member of the London office.<br />
      Today there are 900 people working at Cloudflare spread across offices in San Francisco,
      Austin, Champaign IL, New York, Washington D.C., London, Munich, Singapore and Beijing.
      In London, my “one-person office” (which was my spare bedroom) is now almost 200 people
      and in a month, we’ll move into new space opposite Big Ben.</i>
