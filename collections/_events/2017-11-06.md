      Monitoring the state of our planet has never been more important. Changes on the Earth are
      both cause and consequence of climate change either when the change is human-induced or
      generated from natural events. Having a global perspective on Earth’s climate is thus
      extremely important to constantly observe and record climate change effects. In this
      framework, the eyes in the sky provided by the Earth’s observation satellites represent
      an extremely powerful tool. During the talk, there will be an overview on the multitude
      of information that can be collected about our planet and its climate with satellite sensors.

  - title: "IReact for climate change: predictive mapping"

      This talk will introduce you to IReact, a European project aiming to create a system for
      disaster risk reduction. You will be shown some hazard models, targeting for example heat
      waves in Europe. We will then move to ClimAtlas, an open-source repository for climate data
      in Trentino.
