      MICME is a new platform specifically created to manage the microphonization system in large scale
      events. Smartphones are connected to rooms sound system, so microphones and hostesses are not
      necessary. Downloading is not required. Users can reserve their questions with just one click
      on their smartphones; the server automatically lists the requests in a chronological order. Micme
      allows for a saving of up to 2/3 of the cost of the traditional microphonization systems.

      Since the release of Java 1.4.2 most of the developers thought the language designed by Sun was a
      blast for object-oriented programming and through the years a lot of so-called Java-design-patterns
      infected object-thinking and development process showing us tedious language syntax and dark magics.
      Then, 15 years later, a language by JetBrains tries to simplify the things: Kotlin, what is it?
      What does it try to simplify? Let's see at least 7 inconvenient Java aspects fixed in Kotlin.

      Communication and understanding the client is a key to success when doing freelance projects.
      When failing to communicate well, freelancers risk re-doing the job, wasting time and money, loosing
      reputation. Clients risk missing the deadlines and overspending. But what if we can fix it all with
      a good approach and the right tool?

    description: >
      In 2015 I have started OPPY (One-Project-Per-Year), a meta-project designed to encourage me to
      complete at least one personal technology-related project every year. Since then, I have already
      completed some unconventional projects with unexpected results. The talk will be about my experiences
      and, ultimately, on the importance of fully committing oneself to personal goals, disconnecting with
      technology and reconnecting with people. I hope to inspire some of you.
