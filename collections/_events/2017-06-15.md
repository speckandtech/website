      Communication and understanding the client is a key to success when doing freelance projects.
      When failing to communicate well, freelancers risk re-doing the job, wasting time and money, loosing

      In 2015 I have started OPPY (One-Project-Per-Year), a meta-project designed to encourage me to
      complete at least one personal technology-related project every year. Since then, I have already
      completed some unconventional projects with unexpected results. The talk will be about my experiences
      and, ultimately, on the importance of fully committing oneself to personal goals, disconnecting with
      technology and reconnecting with people. I hope to inspire some of you.
