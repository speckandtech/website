      Long hours spent in the workplace, a stressful workload, and a lack of free time
      have become the measure of productivity for professionals. The answer isn’t more
      hours — it’s less waste, fewer distraction and no toxic behaviours. <br />
      Having a calm and productive environment is a choice. We can do our best and
      deliver an amazing product without making ourselves miserable working like mad
      to meet some insane expectation.<br />
      Federica will show how Fightbean is promoting a respectful and meaningful culture
      to let people do their work in the best-not crazy way possible.

      What if you could spend one fifth of your working day on something you are passionate
      about? What if you could channel all your creativity and inspiration into something
      that you truly believe in, something that may - or may not - benefit your employer's
      business (or your own)? What if I tell you that you could eliminate procrastination
      from your life, simply by spending 20% of your time doing just what you really want
      to do? <br />
      Learn the story of how Google has created Gmail, Adsense, Google News and something
      like 50% of its most profitable services - thanks to its employees building on their
      own ideas, while working in the office.
