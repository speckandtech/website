      Imagine you’re a developer with no knowledge of Unity3D and you have to build a multi-platform game
      from scratch. That’s me few months ago. In this talk I will guide you from zero to Unity3D master,
      sharing the route I’ve followed during the development and the blocks you need to win in order to
      develop your first game. I’m going to talk about:
      * Unity introduction
      * Unity Interface
      * Unity basic components
      * Unity scripting
      * Development tips
      * Learning resources.
