      In this talk, I will discuss about a subject that really matters to me: teaching and
      learning. While I do most of my teaching inside the formal context of the university,
      as a professor, I am more and more interested in promoting education outside the
      classroom, in informal contexts, by involving the most diverse people as tutors and
      mentors. I will focus on computer science, coding and computational thinking, because
      I strongly believe they provide students with a creative form of expression that can
      have a profound impact on the way they learn.
