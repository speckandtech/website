  - title: "Choosing Clojurescript: Why We Chose It As Our Main Language For Pitch.com"
    speakers:
      - name: Jelle Akkerman
        role: Developer & Designer
        org: Pitch

      At Pitch, we made an unconventional choice by picking ClojureScript, a functional
      programming language that compiles to JavaScript, as our primary language. In
      this talk, I will explore the reasons behind this decision, delve into the key
      features of ClojureScript, and share real-life experiences of using it in a
      large-scale codebase. Whether you're new to the language or curious about its
      benefits, this presentation will shed light on the advantages of ClojureScript,
      its impact at Pitch, and how the insights gained can inspire developers across
      various programming languages.

  - title: "Give your Web App superpowers by using GPUs"
    speakers:
      - name: Giulio Zausa
        role: Technical Lead
        org: Flux

      GPUs are cool! You can use them to play games, create entire movies and even run
      machine learning models. By using some native libraries it's possible to embrace
      their powers, using programming languages such as Python or C++. How does this
      work, though, in a world where everything is a web page? New exciting technologies,
      such as WebGL and WebGPU, are giving programmers the full power of the underlying
      hardware. We will see how to build applications that use GPU superpowers to offer
      things that were previously impossible, such as rendering giant scenes or running
      ChatGPT locally in the browser, using some real-world production examples.
