  - title: "AI for Humans: The Future of your Digital Self"
    speakers:
      - name: George Punter
        role: Co-Founder

      In this talk, George will demonstrate the extent and power of personal data collected
      by technology companies. He will explore the potential of personal data to do both
      good and bad, the dangers of giving up your "digital DNA", and the value these
      companies extract from this data.
      Data rights are finally legally recognised. With the combination of GDPR & rising
      awareness of personal data abuse, we might eventually be able to control our data,
      or at least understand as much about our digital footprint as profit-driven companies
      do. AI is only possible because it has data. Imagine your data being used to benefit
      you, instead of targeting you with gambling adverts. Imagine the potential for
      next-generation research to understand our society, which can only happen if we break
      data out from being locked in corporate databases. Data rights are just the start,
      now we need to use them.

  - title: "Computational privacy: balancing privacy and utility in the digital era"

      Data is incredibly useful for innovation, and in particular for business, researchers
      and policy-makers. Ultimately, data has huge potential for social good. However, the
      large-scale collection and use of data raises legitimate privacy concerns, especially
      in light of recent scandals such as the one of Cambridge Analytica. Traditionally, the
      standard tool to share data while protecting privacy has been anonymization. Yet,
      research has shown that this practice is not resistant to a wide range of
      re-identification attacks. In this presentation I will show why anonymization does not
      work for modern behavioral datasets ("big data"). I will also discuss how researchers
      are exploring alternative models to enable the privacy-conscientious use of big data,
      and why this is a never-ending attack/defense game.
