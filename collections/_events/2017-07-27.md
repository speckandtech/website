      Each year a city in California becomes the Mecca for developers, journalists and engineers working
      or passionate about Apple's products. If you are interested in technology that's where new features
      and improvements for Apple's platforms are presented, discussed and dissected. In this speech you'll
      understand how the conference and related events are structured, why you should consider to apply
      for a ticket or a free scholarship and mostly learn of interesting gems announced during #WWDC17,

      I will show some cool features of Kotlin, how it makes developing with Android easy and finally
      we'll see what happens under the hood when we write in Kotlin.
