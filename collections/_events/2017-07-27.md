      Each year a city in California becomes the Mecca for developers, journalists and engineers working
      or passionate about Apple's products. If you are interested in technology that's where new features
      and improvements for Apple's platforms are presented, discussed and dissected. In this speech you'll
      understand how the conference and related events are structured, why you should consider to apply

      Google is adding Kotlin as an official programming language for Android development. Kotlin is a
      language that runs on the JVM and has full interoperability with Java. It costs nothing to adopt!
      I will show some cool features of Kotlin, how it makes developing with Android easy and finally
      we'll see what happens under the hood when we write in Kotlin.
