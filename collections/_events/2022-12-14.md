      Digital products are more complex today than ever before. Creating them
      requires multiple team members and other stakeholders. Design work is not
      something that can happen in isolation, and how effectively we manage others'
      contributions can help us make or break a design. Iâ€™ll share some of the
      things I have learned from past mistakes on how to shape better
      conversations around design work.

      a client? I will walk you through the most common design mistakes to avoid
      via real-life examples so that you can create a website that is delightful
      and that can take you where you want to go!
