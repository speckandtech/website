      A Responsive City is the next generation in urban development after the Smart City.
      Cities become first smart and then responsive: dynamic behaviour differentiates the
      Responsive City from the Smart City 🏃‍♀️ Smart Cities are technology-driven and produce
      large amounts of data. Smart Cities and Smart Buildings are in an early stage of
      development, as every building and every city is a prototype. The Responsive City
      builds on Smart City technology, but places the human in the centre of decision-making,
      design, and management of the city 💁 It uses the stocks and flows of information as
      the main driver of change. Data for the Responsive City come from smart buildings,
      smart infrastructure, and most important, from its citizens.<br />
      To deepen the knowledge about Responsive Cities, we define the concept of Citizen
      Design Science, a combination of Citizen Science and Urban Design. Both are
      conducted, in whole or in part, by citizens or non-professional scientists.
      This approach is still in an early stage of development and, with the Responsive
      Cities research, we aim to explore its potential together with participants around
      the world.

      We are experiencing a transformation of atoms into bits. Atoms are not disappearing
      at all but a huge amount of bits is flanking them and more and more insights and
      actions depends on them. Bits can provide a mirror image of systems, like cars,
      water ducts, and… people. This mirror image can be used to generate information
      on what is going on, what needs are experienced and can be the starting point to
      satisfy them.<br />
      The connections between atoms and bits is becoming ever easier: smartphones can
      provide, as an example, accurate representations of ourselves in specific domains.
      This talk will address both the technology underpinning in the creation of digital
      twins and the economic incentives to have and use them. How will a city get smarter
      and how can we enjoy such a city will be the closing topic of the talk bringing
      examples and laying ideas to discuss.
