      Pixel art always relates into playersâ€™ minds to nostalgia and retro-vibed video
      games, but the potential of this medium assumed a new form during the last decade
      creating a new way game artists can express visual languages and game design
      approaches. Starting from the pixel, the ways it can be shaped to and the study
      of Japanese sprite artists work, pixel art can be a powerful device for designers
      to add to their visual tool belt during game development process.

      Multiplayer games are indeed one of the most involving and addictive gaming
      experiences you could offer to anyone. Everything is simply more funny if you
      can challenge your friends!<br />
      Although nowadays Unity is hugely simplifying game development, when talking
      about making a real-time multiplayer game there are still some non-trivial
      concepts and different patterns to deal with.<br />
      We will explore some of the "quirks and features" that Unity offers to the
      developers in support of this task, from the ready to use Matchmaker down to
      bit-a-bit messages serialization.<br />
      If you wanna create the next Fortnite, this is the talk for ya!
