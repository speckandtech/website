      It is clear that Seoul and Singapore have taken the international lead in turning genuinely smart. This entails knowing everything possible about not just the city but also its inhabitants. The effect is to make people transparent and to hold them accountable for eventual misdeed or misbehaviour. I intend to show how this is done in Singapore. To be fair, the city administration is also keen to be transparent. The people seem to be happy in general with this situation. So the question is: forced by rising worldwide insecurity, will cities such as Paris or Rome, or any other human agglomeration not feel obliged to follow Singapore’s example simply to protect its citizens? What would be the consequences on social behaviour and the people’s welfare? I do not pretend to answer this question myself but to invite a debate either then and there with the audience, or invite the conference planners to set one up. 

  - title: "Smart Cities and Measurable Cities — a technological perspective"

      Smart cities utilize digital technologies and data to improve city operations and services for residents. A smart city requires measuring various city data through sensors and IoT devices. This data helps optimize areas like transportation, infrastructure, and public services. However, collecting and sharing large amounts of citizen data also raises privacy and security issues. Creating an open yet secure city data platform that many stakeholders can access presents technological and coordination challenges. Overall, smart cities aim to enhance life for residents through data-driven improvements, but achieving this vision requires addressing numerous technical, social, and governance complexities.
