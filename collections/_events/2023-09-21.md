      Once introduced the fundamental ideas of quantum computing, we will discuss
      the possibilities offered by quantum computers in machine learning.

  - title: "Privacy In The Era Of Quantum Computers"

    description: >
      The advent of real functional quantum computers will cause a privacy problem.
      Indeed, quantum computers are particularly good at solving algorithms that
      ensure information privacy, like the RSA algorithm. In this talk, we will see
      how quantum computers can be used to restore unconditional security and privacy.
