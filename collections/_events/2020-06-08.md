      Few weeks after #COVID19 was detected outside of China, a new topic started to
      gain traction: an app for smartphone can help perform contact tracing and therefore
      limit the spread of the disease. Join me in the journey lived by countries, experts, companies, researchers and citizens, that will end with the #immuni app installed
      on our phones. Why we should definitely install it and convince others to do it too.
