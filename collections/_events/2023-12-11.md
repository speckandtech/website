  - title: Delve Into the World of the Human Microbiome and Metagenomics
    speakers:
      - name: Mattia Bolzan
        role: CTO
        org: Prebiomics

      Shotgun metagenomics provides a comprehensive snapshot of the entire microbial
      community present in a given environment. PreBiomics, an academic start-up of
      the University of Trento, employs state-of-the-art sequencing technologies
      and bioinformatics tools to allow the identification and characterization of
      the multitude of known and unknown bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms
      present, shedding light on their functional capabilities, interactions, and potential
      impact on health or specific applications. During the talk, we will see an example
      of how the human microbiome is emerging as a key target of personalized medicine.

  - title: How Does Biocentis Model, Simulate, and Optimize the Release of Gene-Drive Insects?
    speakers:
      - name: Matteo Rucco
        role: Data Scientist
        org: Biocentis

    description: >
      In this talk we will present Biocentis, a biotech startup whose mission is to apply
      innovative gene-editing techniques to mitigate agriculture and public health issues
      dictated by malicious insects, being either pests or human-disease vectors. To
      achieve this goal we implement gene-drive, genetic tools to control the insect
      population size by selectively reducing insect fertility. However, Biocentis is
      not only molecular biology: we believe that computer and data science represent
      key factors to inform and guide strategic decisions. Today we will present the
      modeling and simulation framework whose design and implementation are the current
      focus of the Biocentis data team, a component that aims at providing accurate and
      fine-grained simulations of all relevant aspects affecting an insect life cycle:
      from the genome to the phenotype up to higher behavioral and ecological implications.
      In addition, we will brief you on how we are using mathematical and data-driven
      approaches to optimize the release strategy of transgenic insects.
