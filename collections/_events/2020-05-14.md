      We’ve all seen news stories about the Internet being threatened by #COVID19.
      As people were forced to work from home and children to study over the Internet,
      some worried it would collapse. We heard how Netflix and others had to reduce
      their streaming quality to stop European networks from being overloaded. I’ll talk
      about what really happened and what had to be done to keep the Internet running
      smoothly.
