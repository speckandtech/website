      Someone says "all roads lead to Rome", but for GRUBER Logistics there is only
      one right route to bring our customer's goods from the loading to the unloading
      place. Having a predefined route, without leaving the driver to follow any
      route suggested by their device, is the basis to guarantee correct planning,
      on-time delivery, and cost control. We will present the solution developed
      inside our GRUBER Beyond platform, to certify the route a driver has to follow:
      the talk will focus both on the user experience and on the architecture applied
      to implement the new feature on top of our legacy TMS.

  - title: "Break it up! 5G, cruise control, autonomous vehicle cooperation, and bending the rules"
    speakers:
      - name: Paolo Casari
        role: Associate Professor
        org: University of Trento

    description: >
      Controlling groups of autonomous vehicles from a wireless network requires
      low delays, high reliability, and computing power close-by. Even though 5G cellular
      networks will provide these ingredients, high delays or connectivity interruptions
      may still lead to catastrophic consequences. We will present a novel solution to
      tackle these issues, based on a balanced mix of network, computing, and vehicle
      autonomy management. We will then discuss how to break it up, so that autonomous
      vehicles can bend traffic laws in case of emergency.
