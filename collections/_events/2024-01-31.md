      Every day, we're inundated with a staggering amount of information that
      continues to grow exponentially. How can we process all these inputs and grasp
      even a fraction of the available knowledge? In my talk, I'll offer a personal
      reflection on information design and its tools for accessing the world's complexity
      without necessarily simplifying it. And, why not, I'll also share how I planned
      a data-driven visit to my favorite theme park.

  - title: "Data Activism: Data as Rhetoric, Data as Power"
    speakers:
      - name: Alice Corona
        role: Partner & Data Journalist
        org: Sheldon Studio
        org_link: https://sheldon.studio

    description: >
      Contrary to popular beliefs that depict data as truthful or objective, a data
      activist navigates the data-sphere from an opposite worldview: data is never
      neutral, and data visualization is inevitably rhetorical. But donâ€™t worry: this
      is a feature, not a bug. This talk will focus on the many ways in which data can
      be used for activism, with a particular focus on data-inspired housing rights
      initiatives like Inside Airbnb and OCIO Venezia, and the works by the information
      design studio Sheldon.studio.
