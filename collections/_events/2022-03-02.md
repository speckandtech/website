      Formula SAE is one of the most challenging, fun, and ambitious projects that a student
      can take part in. It’s a worldwide championship between college Universities where
      each team has the objective of designing, building, and racing a single-seat racing
      car. In this talk, we will present our team and we will dive deeper into the technologies
      that we use to develop every control unit in the vehicle.
