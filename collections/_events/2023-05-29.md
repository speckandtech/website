      Perlmutter is the newest supercomputer at Berkeley Lab, California, and
      features a whopping 35 PB all-flash Lustre file system. Let's dive into
      its architecture, showing some early performance figures and unique performance
      considerations, using low-level Lustre tests that achieve over 90% of the
      theoretical bandwidth of the SSDs, to showcase how Perlmutter achieves the
      performance of a burst buffer and the resilience of a scratch file system.
      Lastly, some performance considerations unique to an all-flash Lustre file
      system, along with tips on how better I/O patterns can make the most of
      such powerful architectures.

  - title: "Behind the scenes of our everyday Internet: the role of an IXP like MIX"
    speakers:
      - name: Simone Morandini
        role: Network engineer
        org: MIX

      Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) play an important role in the architecture
      of the modern Internet, but they are mostly transparent for the end users
      and therefore are an often unknown piece of the puzzle. This talk wants to
      shed some light on what happens "behind the scenes" of the daily usage of
      the Internet, and why a growing number of operators choose to connect to
      MIX, the largest IXP in Italy.
