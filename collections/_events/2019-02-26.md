      If you develop or distribute software of any kind, you are vulnerable to whole categories
      of attacks upon yourself or your loved ones. This includes blackmail, extortion or "just"
      simple malware injection‚Ä¶ By targeting software developers such as yourself, malicious
      actors, including nefarious governments, can infect and attack thousands ‚Äî if not
      millions ‚Äî of end users. How can we avert this? The idea behind "reproducible" builds
      is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during build processes;
      this prevents against the installation of backdoor- introducing malware on developers'
      machines, ensuring attempts at extortion and other forms of subterfuge are quickly
      uncovered and thus ultimately futile. Through a story of three different developers,
      this talk will engage you on this growing threat to you and how it affects everyone
      involved in the production lifecycle of software development, as well as how
      reproducible builds can help prevent against it.

  - title: Say No to the Dependency Hell
    speakers:

      Modern software projects cannot exist without open source software (OSS). It allows
      software projects to have rapid growth, credibility, and trust of their users. However,
      the wide adoption of OSS also brings huge security risks ‚ö†Ô∏è Improper maintenance of OSS
      components may result in serious and costly security breaches, like the Equifax case,
      when the company lost 100K credit card profiles. In this talk, we will have an overview
      of the current problems regarding the management of third-party components of software
      projects, the ways how to address them, and I will also present you our methodology for
      identification of possible security issues coming from OSS dependencies üë®‚Äçüíª The methodology
      demonstrated its sustainability being used by SAP, a large international software
      development company.
