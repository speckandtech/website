      A company is like a baby, one leg representing business and the other standing for technology. Moving
      the first steps as a startup is hard, accelerating to run as a company is even harder: you have to grow
      up with both legs keeping pace.<br />
      OpenMove will give its perspective on major challenges faced to bring the company to market its products
      in 6 countries, dealing with high-profile customers like Ministries of Transport or big telcos… guys you
      don’t wanna mess with!<br />
      On the business side, Lorenzo, CEO, will tell how they have been structuring product- and
      knowledge-management, business development (and some other super boring stuff), while Michele, CTO, will
      show the cool things: scalability and high availability of the platform adopting Docker Swarm,
      optimization by using Meteor.js and MongoDB and evolution towards an ecosystem of microservices.

  - title: "The tricky road to autonomous cars"
    speakers:
      - name: Paolo Costa
        name_link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolocostaprofile/
        role: Founding Partner

      A self-driving car is hyper-communication: a system communicating with more elements, more frequently, and
      in real-time. But to what extent can unmanned vehicles trust communication to make their own decisions? In
      other terms, how autonomous will be autonomous cars, once they reach the so-called ‘fifth level of autonomy’?
      Spindox is involved in 2 different research programs working on this question. We will give our vision for
      the mid-term scenario, from both a technical and a business perspective: architectural view, industry role,
      sourcing and delivery strategies. More specifically, we are presenting a proposed model for the data layer
      within this architecture, that addressed most of foreseen technical issues.
