      As serverless architectures become more popular, developers and architects need
      a framework of patterns to design their workloads without managing servers or operating
      systems, without friction or operational heavy lifting. This session will describe
      reusable advanced patterns across multiple domains and scenarios, from web development
      to data analysis, all the way to artificial intelligence.
