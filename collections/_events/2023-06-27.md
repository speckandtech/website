      Forests are vital to our planet's health and to many human activities. Given
      the increasing impact of climate change and human actions, monitoring the
      condition of our forests has become imperative. At the Forest Ecology Unit
      of Fondazione Edmund Mach, we employ an array of cutting-edge technologies to
      examine forest dynamics and enhance management practices. From tree-mounted
      sensors to orbiting satellites, the talk will provide an overview of the
      technologies at our disposal and how we are using them.
