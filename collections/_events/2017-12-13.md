      Being able to design and develop products and keeping them consistent along the process
      it's tough! There are hundreds of thousands of decisions that your team needs to take
      every single day and without a clear design framework to rely on you'll probably have
      an inconsistent and hard-to-use outcome. In the same way, your product will be hard
      to develop, maintain and it'll cost you a lot of $$$.
      During the talk, there will be an overview on how to create a design system and how
      this will help your whole team in developing new products. Moreover, we will discover
      what developers can teach to designers about product design and vice-versa
