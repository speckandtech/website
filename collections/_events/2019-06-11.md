      Live Quiz is the most popular Italian game show you can play on your smartphone:
      every day about 100k people play the quiz at the same time and try to win the daily
      prize. Despite the simple appearance, the game is much more complex than you might
      think. In this talk, we will explore the backstage of Live Quiz and see what
      guarantees a perfect game experience every day.

      Fatture in Cloud was born in late 2013 on a single-server machine and scaled
      from zero to 35k customers at the end of 2018. Then, we faced the mandatory
      electronic invoicing which came into effect in Italy on 1st January 2019, and we
      experienced a huge growth to 350k customers in few months. In these 5 years,
      I've learned a lot about cloud architecture, scalability, optimization, DevOps,
      and we eventually achieved a 99,99% uptime even in the huge growth period.
