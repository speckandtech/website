      Why a retreat?
    </h3>

    <p>
      The Speck&amp;Tech Retreat is <b>THE</b> event you can't miss! On October 4-6, our Speckers will reunite to
      strengthen their relationships, learn from each other, <b>have fun</b>, discuss together trending hot topics and
      spend an <b>unforgettable weekend</b> with old and new friends.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2018 over 50 participants gathered in Dimaro for <a href="//youtu.be/U8o5CL9-_98">a great 3-day event</a> and
      they became more than 60 <a href="//youtu.be/H25jP01VOSw">one year later, in 2019</a>. After two years of
      pandemic, we managed to bring that <b>festive spirit again</b>, and
      <a href="//youtu.be/PRhpeAC46As">in 2022 we were 80 people</a> in total! One year later, in 2023, we finally hit
      the magic number: <a href="//youtu.be/TZcJImCtiEA">100 beautiful Speckers</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
      This October we will be back for the 5th time and, as always, we want to offer you a broad range of activities
      that will not only boost your career from a
      <b>professional and personal</b> point of view, but will also allow you to take a short holiday with the people
      you love, surrounded by a stunning environment and relaxing views.
    </p>

    <p>
      The programme covers a multitude of distinct areas, from technical and stimulating <b>talks</b> to enriching
      <b>workshops</b>, from <b>outdoor activities</b> in the Alps to long relaxing hours in <b>SPA and sauna</b>, from
      gamified visits of top <b>tech companies</b> to tasty <b>gourmet dinners</b>.

    <details>
      <summary>What if I am not one of the first 50 successful applicants?</summary>
      <p>Given the limited spots available, we cannot guarantee the participation of each member. In case all tickets are sold out, a waiting list will be set up. If a ticket becomes available, you will be contacted automatically with further instructions on how to get it.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I choose with whom to stay in my room?</summary>

    <details>

      <p>Not really, the event starts at 5 PM on Friday, when we will meet at the train station in Trento. However, we encourage you to tell your employer about this event, so they might even grant you a half-day permit because of being a company's ambassador, or record your attendance at Saturday‚Äôs conference as a learning experience.</p>
