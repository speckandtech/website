      Since 2016, Speck&Tech has brought together digital companies, researchers, scientists, designers, startuppers,
      and students under one roof. <i>Nel suo piccolo</i>, the association helped evolve the tech landscape of Trentino,
      enabling its audience to <b>learn new things</b> and <b>meet new people</b>.

      Organizing events, buying beer and speck, managing accounting, booking venues, and other related activities all
      come with costs. If you appreciate our efforts, you can support the Association in three ways:
