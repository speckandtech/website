    <h2>A different way to network, outdoors</h2>
    <p>
      Speck&Trek is an initiative born from the idea of exploring the territory around us together with our community. We meet up, hike towards a destination—whether it's a peak, a mountain hut, or a scenic viewpoint—and once we arrive, we talk about tech, eat together, and hang out. A different way to network, outdoors.
