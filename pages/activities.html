    <p>
      Speck&Tech is more than just monthly meetups. Over the years we have developed several community-driven activities
      that extend our mission beyond the stage. Whether it's helping elderly people approach the digital world or
      combining hiking with deep tech conversations, these initiatives bring technology closer to people in new and
      meaningful ways.
