      Our events aim to provide a fun and welcoming experience for everyone. We embrace diversity in gender identity and
      expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack
      thereof), and technology choices.
    </p>
    <p lg>
      We have zero tolerance for harassment of event participants. Anyone violating these rules may face sanctions or
      expulsion from future events at the organizers' discretion.
    </p>
    <p lg>Be kind and respectful. Treat others as youâ€™d like to be treated!</p>

      We are very happy of the friendly environment of Speck&Tech. However, if you feel that there is something wrong
      going on please contact a member of the Association. If you don't know anyone from the Association, we usually have
      a person at the entrance of the room. They will meet with you right away and handle the issue immediately.
    </p>
    <p>Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated at Speck&Tech. This includes:</p>
    <p>
      - offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
      race or religion - sexual images in public spaces - deliberate intimidation - stalking, following, harassing
      photography or recording - sustained disruption of talks or other events - inappropriate physical contact or
      unwelcome sexual attention
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior must immediately comply. **If a participant engages in any of the
      aforementioned behavior, we may take any action we deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately
      expelling them from our events**.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
      member of the Association immediately.
    </p>
    <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all our events and conference-related social events.</p>
