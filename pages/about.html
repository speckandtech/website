    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>In a nutshell, Speck&Tech is the digital community of Trentino.</p>
    <p>
      In a few more words, we’re a non-profit association formed by a group of enthusiasts (some might call us nerds or
      geeks) with a clear goal in mind: creating a community of people united by the passion for technology, innovation,
      and much more. We meet every month (possibly even more frequently), and since 2016, we fostered the exchange of
      ideas by <a href="https://speckand.tech/events">hosting more than a hundred free events</a> in our city,
      <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Trento">Trento</a>, and sorroundings. These monthly gatherings mirror
      the typical meetup scheme found in major cities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>One topic.</b> This can vary a lot, but it will always be tackled from a technological or scientific
        perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Two talks.</b> The more diverse, the better. In-depth technical presentations? Got ‘em. Entrepreneurial
        advice and hands-on experiences? For sure. Philosophical discussions? Piece of cake.
      </li>
      <li><b>Half an hour each.</b> Let’s keep it simple.</li>
      <li>
        Usually delivered in <b>English</b>. As much as we love to sprinkle some “dialetto trentino” here and there, we
        care deeply about our non-Italian friends and we always try to make our events accessible to them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hot five-minute <b>Q&A session</b>. Not enough? There’s time to go on asking questions while sipping a beer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Networking</b>. This is the real deal. Speck*, beers, and chiacchiere (*we have vegetarian/vegan-friendly
        options, as well). Here’s where job opportunities arise, friendships come to life and the most interesting
        discussions take place.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our community now counts thousands of people, all scattered around the World. No, for real. Hola, Ciao, おはよう,
      Bonjour, Добрий день to all of you! There are so many things we’d like to tell you, so here’s a brief recap of how
      we got here.
    </p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>
      Founded on March 1, 2016, by a group of young tech enthusiasts, Speck&Tech was officially registered as
      “Associazione Culturale” on April 18, 2017. Since its inception, the association has pursued an ambitious and
      clear goal, as stated in the motto on the homepage and in the section above: to create a community of people
      united by the passion for technology, innovation, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, we have undertaken initiatives of all kinds. These range from “itinerant” events (held in Piazza
      Duomo at <a href="/2018/04/future-cities">#TSCW18</a>, in Munich, at the Caproni Airport during
      <a href="/2018/09/ibelievespeckcanfly">Festivolare</a>, at UniTrento’s Auditorium, at Wired Next Fest Rovereto 24,
      etc.) to collaborations with international players and local authorities. A notable example is the
      <a href="/2019/03/muse-next-1-guida-galattica-per-specker">MUSE::Next</a> series — three events organized with
      Trento's Museum of Science that drew over 300 participants on its opening night. We’ve co-organized a
      <a href="/2017/10/hackdev17">Hackathon</a> with the Government's Digital Team in 2017 and established the
      acclaimed <a href="/retreat">Speck&Tech Retreat</a>, now at its fifth edition: a weekend getaway in the mountains
      blending outdoor activities in the Dolomites with Trentino gourmet cuisine, career fairs, SPA relaxation, talks,
      and technical workshops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of 2020, we launched a podcast to keep our audience engaged and explore new media horizons. This
      experimental venture received positive feedback and helped us navigate the challenging period of the Covid-19
      pandemic. In October 2021, after an 18-month hiatus from in-person events, Speck&Tech as we know it finally came
      back with its monthly meetups at <a href="https://trento.impacthub.net/">Impact Hub Trentino</a>. The revival was
      made possible by the influx of new members and the contributions of additional volunteers, bringing the total
      membership to about 15.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 2023, the Association introduced two new activity branches: <b>Pan e Botóni</b> and <b>Speck&Trek</b>.
      The first is based on the idea that no one should be left behind, and it’s one of our responsibilities to help
      each other. Therefore with many other private and public stakeholders, we have put together a series of free
      workshops to help elderly people with their smartphones, whether that means installing apps, managing their photo
      albums, avoiding phishing attempts, and much more. Pan e Botóni’s schedule is always evolving, date and
      location-wise. You can stay up-to-date by subscribing to our newsletter here.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Speck&Trek, it’s pretty self-explanatory: we like hiking, we like talking about tech and we like hanging
      out together. Mix these ingredients and you get the recipe for Speck&Trek. A few photos say more than a thousand
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, it’s been a great journey so far and we keep adding new things and reaching new highs. When we began,
      it felt like we would only reach friends and family, but in the last couple of years, we’ve managed to host events
      with <a href="/2019/01/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-speck">John Graham-Cumming</a> (CTO @ Cloudflare),
      <a href="2024/04/digital-freedom">Richard Stallman</a>,
      <a href="/2024/03/buon-sangue-non-mente">Stefano Nazzi</a>, and other amazing guests from many different fields of
      science and technology. We have built stronger relationships with the local administration, cultural institutions,
      and other fellow non-profit organizations.
    </p>
    <p>What next? It’s up to us, and potentially to you, to decide.</p>
