    <p>S&T is the digital community of Trentino.</p>
    <p>
      Founded on March 1, 2016 by a group of young enthusiasts (some might call them nerds or geeks), Speck&Tech was
      officially registered as <b>“Associazione Culturale”</b> on April 18, 2017. Since its inception, the association
      has pursued an ambitious and clear goal, as stated in the motto on the homepage: to create a <b>community</b> of
      people united by the <b>passion</b> for technology, innovation, and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
      We fostered the exchange of ideas by hosting <a href="/events"><b>more than 60 monthly events</b></a> in our city,
      <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Trento">Trento</a>. These gatherings mirror the typical meetups found
      in major American and European cities: <b>two talks</b>, each lasting about half an hour, on a shared theme,
      usually delivered in English, followed by a five-minute Q&A session.
    </p>

    <p>
      The talks often pair contrasting approaches: an in-depth, technical presentation followed by a more approachable
      one. Alternatively, we might combine a technical standpoint with an entrepreneurial perspective, or even a
      scientific lecture with a philosophical conversation. After the formal presentations, attendees are invited to
      enjoy a convivial <b>networking session</b>, mingling with speakers and fellow “Speckers” while savoring
      <b>speck</b> (our famous local cold cut) and a few beers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, the Association has undertaken numerous initiatives. These range from “itinerant” events (held in
      Piazza Duomo at <a href="/2018/04/future-cities">#TSCW18</a>, in Munich, at the Caproni Airport during
      <a href="/2018/09/ibelievespeckcanfly">Festivolare</a>, and at several UniTrento locations) to collaborations with
      international players and local authorities. A notable example is the
      <a href="2019/03/muse-next-1-guida-galattica-per-specker">MUSE::Next</a> series — a triptych of events organized
      with Trento's Museum of Science that drew over 300 participants on its opening night. The Association has also
      co-organized a <a href="/2017/10/hackdev17">Hackathon</a> with the Government's Digital Team in 2017 and
      established the acclaimed <a href="/retreat">Speck&Tech Retreat</a>, now at its fifth edition: a weekend getaway
      in the mountains blending outdoor activities in the Dolomites with Trentino gourmet cuisine, career fairs, SPA
      relaxation, talks, and technical workshops.
    </p>

      Towards the end of 2020, Speck&Tech launched a podcast to keep their audience engaged and explore new media
      horizons. This experimental venture received positive feedback and helped the Association navigate the challenging
      period of the Covid-19 pandemic. In October 2021, after an 18-month hiatus from in-person events, Speck&Tech
      resumed organizing its monthly meetups at Impact Hub Trentino. The revival was made possible by the influx of new
      members and the contributions of additional volunteers, bringing the total membership to about 15.

    <p>In 2023, the Association introduced two new activity branches: <i>Pan e Botóni</i> and <i>Speck&Trek</i>.</p>
