            Speck&Tech is the digital community of Trentino. Founded on March
            1st, 2016 by a group of youngsters, who some people would define
            nerds or geeks, it was then officially registered as an
            <b>“Associazione Culturale”</b> on April 18th, 2017. Since its
            birth, Speck&Tech has always had an ambitious and precise goal (as
            one can still read in the motto on the homepage), that is to create
            a <b>community</b> of people, even very different from each other,
            united by a <b>passion for technology and innovation</b>, who want
            to exchange ideas and knowledge about these and related topics.
          </p>

          <p>
            How? Mainly through <b>monthly events</b> - over 50 in recent years,
            <a href="https://speckand.tech/archive/"
              >you can find them all here</a
            >
            - which resemble the typical meetups of large American and European
            cities: <b>two talks of about half an hour</b> on the same theme,
            generally in English, followed by 5 minutes of Q&A. A more technical
            presentation, a more divulgative one; or maybe a more
            “developer-like” and a more entrepreneurial one, or a scientific and
            a philosophical one. This is then followed by a convivial part of
            <b>networking</b>, where the participants discuss together with the
            speakers and the other <i>Speckers</i>, eat <b>speck</b> (the famous
            local cold cuts) and drink a few beers.

            Along these years, the Association's initiatives have been many:
            from simple "itinerant" Speck&Tech (in Piazza Duomo at
            <a href="/2018/04/future-cities/">#TSCW18</a>, in Munich, at the
            Caproni Airport during
            <a href="https://speckand.tech/2018/09/ibelievespeckcanfly/"
              >Festivolare</a
            >, at the UniTrento CLab...), to various collaborations with
            interational players and local authorities (the triptych of events
            <a
              href="https://speckand.tech/2019/03/mn-guida-galattica-per-specker/"
              >MUSE::Next</a
            >
            organized with the Museum of Science, which registered over 300
            participants in its first night, is memorable); from the
            <a href="https://speckand.tech/2017/10/hack-developers/"
              >Hackathon</a
            >
            co-organized with the <b>Government's Digital Team</b> in 2017 to
            the renowned
            <a href="https://speckand.tech/2019/10/speckandtech-retreat-v2/"
              >Speck&Tech Retreat</a
            >, the weekend in the mountains where outdoor activities in the
            <b>Dolomites</b> are combined with Trentino gourmet food, career
            fairs, relaxation in the spa, talks and technical workshops.
          </p>

          <p>
            Towards the end of 2020, both to keep our audience engaged and to
            explore new horizons, Speck&Tech also launched a
            <a href="https://anchor.fm/speckandtech/">podcast</a>: it was an
            experiment, which received good feedback and helped the Association
            overcome the challenging period of the Covid-19 pandemic. From
            October 2021, after over a year and a half without events in
            attendance and thanks to the entry of fresh forces into the
            Association and the contribution of <b>new volunteers</b> (to date
            there are about 15 members), Speck&Tech has returned to organize its
            <b>monthly meetups</b> at Impact Hub Trentino, as well as a series
            of new initiatives, such as Speck&Trek.
